# Fun typeracer 
This is something similar to typeracer, but it is on a smaller scale, and with some (funny) modifications (pranks to typers)

**Modifications:**
+ Remap the keys to a random layout
+ Caps lock is always on
+ Double press to register a key
+ Latency until registered
+ Commonly misspelled words

The code could have been done better such as better error handling and more structured, as this is a quickie for an event.

## Running for development
**For frontend:**
`cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev`
**For backend:**
`cd backend && npm install && npm run dev`
